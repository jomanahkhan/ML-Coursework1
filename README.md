# **ML Coursework 1: Regression Model for Outcome Prediction**  

This repository contains my submission for **Machine Learning Coursework 1**, where I developed a regression model to predict the `outcome` variable based on a given dataset. The objective is to build the **best possible predictive model** and achieve a high **RÂ² score** on a hidden test set.

## **ðŸ“Œ Coursework Objective**  
The goal of this coursework is to:
- Train a **high-performance regression model** using `CW1_train.csv`.
- Make predictions on **CW1_test.csv** (where true outcomes are hidden).
- Submit the predicted values in the required format for evaluation.

## **ðŸš€ How to Generate Predictions**
Follow these steps to generate predictions using the trained model:

1. **Place `CW1_test.csv` inside the `/data` directory** in this repository.  
2. **Run all cells in `final_model.ipynb`** using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
3. The predictions will be saved as:
